------------------- GET_CORRELATION_FUNCTIONS ---------------------------
-> get_correlation_functions.cxx correctly outputs all raw data from *.608 
-> -> and *.616
-> I am confident that get_correlation_functions is correctly obtaining data
--> less confident that it's actually being stored well. 

------------------- GET_JACKKNIFE_MEANS ---------------------------
-> UPDATE: data is confirmed as stored from get_correlation_functions.
--> get_jacknife_means.cxx obtains correct data in function log before performing operations.
--> The rest of the file operations are so self-evident and elementary that I believe no further tests are needed (on get_jackknife_means)
NOTE: ALL ABOVE TESTS WERE ONLY ON THE THREE-POINT CORRELATION FUNCTIONS

------------------- GET_JACKKNIFE_RATIOS ---------------------------
