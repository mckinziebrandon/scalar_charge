------------------- GET_CORRELATION_FUNCTIONS ---------------------------
-> get_correlation_functions.cxx correctly outputs all raw data from *.608 
-> -> and *.616
-> I am confident that get_correlation_functions is correctly obtaining data
--> less confident that it's actually being stored well. 

------------------- GET_JACKKNIFE_MEANS ---------------------------
-> UPDATE: data is confirmed as stored from get_correlation_functions.
--> get_jacknife_means.cxx obtains correct data in function log before performing operations.
--> The rest of the file operations are so self-evident and elementary that I believe no further tests are needed (on get_jackknife_means)
NOTE: ALL ABOVE TESTS WERE ONLY ON THE THREE-POINT CORRELATION FUNCTIONS

07/10/2015: DDAY == DEBUGGING DAY ; THE END OF TIMES ; THE END OF ERRORS ; TIME IS NOW

------------------- GET_CORRELATION_FUNCTIONS ---------------------------
C2:
==> data.Getline(inFile) retrieves & loops data correctly. 
==> data.Getline(inFile) time-translates data correctly.
==> data acquisition in general is perfect BEFORE actually filling nTuples. 
==> entries are going into C2 Ntuple. I have no reason to believe they are being collected wrong.
    I am confident this is NOT the source of the error I'm searching for. 

==> In fact, I am confident the entire file is correct. The problem is not here. It is just not possible. 

------------------- GET_JACKKNIFE_MEANS ---------------------------
OH MY FUCKING GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME IT WAS ONE GODDAMN NUMBER?????? THATS IT???
